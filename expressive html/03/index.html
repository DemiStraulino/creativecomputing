			On a starr’d night Prince Lucifer uprose. 
			<br>Tired of his dark dominion swung the fiend </br>
			<br></br>
			<br></br>
			<br>Above the rolling ball in cloud part screen’d, </br>
			<br>Where sinners hugg’d their spectre of repose. </br>
			<br>Poor prey to his hot fit of pride were those. </br>
			<br></br>
			<br></br>
			<br></br>
			<br>And now upon his western wing he lean’d, </br>
			<br>Now his huge bulk o’er Afric’s sands careen’d, </br>
			<br>Now the black planet shadow’d Arctic snows. </br>
			<br></br>
			<br></br>
			<br>Soaring through wider zones that prick’d his scars </br>
			<br>With memory of the old revolt from Awe, </br>
			<br>He reach’d a middle height, and at the stars, </br>
			<br></br>
			<br></br>
			<br></br>
			<br></br>
			<br>Which are the brain of heaven, he look’d, and sank. </br>
			<br>Around the ancient track march’d, rank on rank, </br>
			<br>The army of unalterable law.</p>br>
