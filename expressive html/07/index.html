			<h1>On a starr’d night <strong>Prince Lucifer</strong> <em>uprose</em>. </h1>

			<h2><br>Tired of his <strong>dark</strong> dominion swung the fiend </br></h2>

			<h3><br>Above the rolling ball in cloud part screen’d, </br></h3>

			<h4><br>Where <strong><em>sinners</em></strong> hugg’d their spectre of repose. </br></h4>

			<h5><br><em>Poor prey</em> to his hot fit of pride were those. </br></h5>

			<h6><br>And now upon his western wing he lean’d, </br></h6>

			<h5><br>Now his huge bulk o’er Afric’s sands <em>careen’d</em>, </br></h5>

			<h4><br>Now the <strong>black planet <em>shadow’d</em></strong> Arctic snows. </br></h4>

			<h3><br>Soaring through wider zones that prick’d his scars </br></h3>

			<h2><br>With memory of the old revolt from Awe, </br></h2>

			<h1><br>He reach’d a middle height, and at the stars, </br></h1>

			<h3><br>Which are the <em>brain</em>of heaven, he look’d, and sank. </br></h3>

			<h5><br>Around the ancient track march’d, rank on rank, </br></h5>

			<h6><br>The army of <em>unalterable</em> law.</p></br></h6>
