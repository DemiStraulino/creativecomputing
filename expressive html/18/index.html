					<li>On a starr’d night Prince Lucifer uprose</li>
					<li>Tired of his dark dominion swung the fiend </li>
					<li>Above the rolling ball in cloud part screen’d, </li>
					<li>Where sinners hugg’d their spectre of repose. </li>
					<li>Poor prey to his hot fit of pride were those. </li>
					<li>And now upon his western wing he lean’d, </li>
					<li>Now his huge bulk o’er Afric’s sands careen’d, </li>
					<li>Now the black planet shadow’d Arctic snows. </li>
					<li>Soaring through wider zones that prick’d his scars </li>
					<li>With memory of the old revolt from Awe, </li>
					<li>He reach’d a middle height, and at the stars, </li>
					<li>Which are the brain of heaven, he look’d, and sank. </li>
					<li>Around the ancient track march’d, rank on rank, </li>
					<li>The army of unalterable law.</li>
