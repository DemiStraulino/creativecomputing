					On a starr’d night Prince Lucifer uprose</br>
					Tired of his dark dominion swung the fiend </br>
					Above the rolling ball in cloud part screen’d, </br>
					Where sinners hugg’d their spectre of repose. </br>
					Poor prey to his hot fit of pride were those. </br>
				</h6>

				<h4>
					And now upon his western wing he lean’d, </br>
					Now his huge bulk o’er Afric’s sands careen’d, </br>
					Now the black planet shadow’d Arctic snows. </br>
					Soaring through wider zones that prick’d his scars </br>
				</h4>

				<h6>
					With memory of the old revolt from Awe, </br>
					He reach’d a middle height, and at the stars, </br>
					Which are the brain of heaven, he look’d, and sank. </br>
					Around the ancient track march’d, rank on rank, </br>
					The army of unalterable law.</br>
